1
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,650
BILLY: OH.
OLIVIA: HERE WE GO. OK.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,494
WHAT IS--
WHAT IS THIS?

3
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:15,540
WELL, IT'S BLUEBERRY
AND RICOTTA TOAST.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,584
BLUEBERRY AND RICOTTA.
WHAT--

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,946
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE EGGS AND THE

6
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,230
CRACKLIN' BACON AND--

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,793
I THINK IT LOOKS
GREAT, HONEY.

8
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,436
- IT TASTES GREAT, TOO.
- YOU SEE, DAD?

9
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:25,481
JORDAN'S INHALING HIS.
BILLY: OK.

10
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:27,004
DAD, IF YOU DON'T WANT YOURS,
I CAN TAKE IT OFF YOUR PLATE.

11
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:28,848
EXCUSE ME.
GREEDY WITH YOUR--

12
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,952
BILLY: LET ME--ALL RIGHT.

13
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,742
OLIVIA: WELL?

14
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,786
I STAND CORRECTED.
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

15
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,390
OLIVIA: I KNOW.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,274
WAY TO GO.

17
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,877
SO, HAVE YOU,

18
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,122
DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
SAY TO YOUR TEAM TODAY?

19
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,206
I'M, STILL
WORKING ON IT.

20
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,050
OLIVIA: WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?
JORDAN:.

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,096
AFTER TODAY'S
SPRING COMBINE,
DAD'S GONNA TELL

22
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:52,140
HIS TEAM THAT HE'S
LEAVING CRENSHAW
FOR THE GAU JOB.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,264
OLIVIA: HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL TAKE IT?
BILLY: I DON'T KNOW.

24
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,790
COACHING CHANGE
AT THIS LEVEL, THEY HIT
A LITTLE BIT HARDER, SO...

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,236
OLIVIA: 
BILLY: THE PLAYERS LOOK
AT ME AS A FATHER FIGURE.

26
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:01,560
GRACE IS GONNA BE THERE...
JORDAN:

27
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,184
BILLY: IF THE PLAYERS
NEED HELP AFTERWARDS.
JORDAN: AND I'LL BE THERE.

28
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,048
BILLY: YES.
OLIVIA: WHY ARE YOU GOING?

29
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,092
BECAUSE BEVERLY PLAYERS
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

30
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,776
I'M GONNA HELP OUT
WITH THE DRILLS,
YOU KNOW, THROWING

31
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:10,140
TO THE WIDE RECEIVERS.
BILLY: YOU THINK

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,903
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD
WANT TO HELP OUT,

33
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,707
LIKE--LIKE SPENCER?
I KNOW THE PLAYERS
LOOK UP TO HIM.

34
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,712
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LAURA: BABE.

35
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,636
BILLY: 
LAURA: IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

36
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,280
WITH SPENCER,
JUST CALL HIM.

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,524
TAKE THE FIRST STEP.

38
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,770
OLIVIA: WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU LIKED THE BLUEBERRY
AND RICOTTA TOAST...

39
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,774
JORDAN: 
OLIVIA: BUT I CAN'T
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT

40
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:27,658
BECAUSE IT'S LAYLA'S RECIPE.
JORDAN: WHAT?

41
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:29,302
REALLY?
NEVER MADE THIS FOR ME.

42
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,306
WHY WOULD LAYLA
MAKE YOU BREAKFAST?

43
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,832
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

44
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:35,956
LAURA: YOU GUYS,
I MISSED THIS,

45
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:38,040
THE FOUR OF US.
BILLY: YEAH. THIS IS NICE.

46
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,764
WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OFTEN.

47
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,528
OLIVIA: I'M IN.
JORDAN: ME, TOO.

48
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,132
LAURA: YEAH?
OLIVIA: YEAH.

49
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,696
LAURA: SO, LIKE, WHAT?
ONCE A WEEK?

50
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:46,540
OLIVIA:...
JORDAN: WELL...

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,182
BILLY: HA HA HA!
OLIVIA: I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

52
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:51,070
LAURA, CHUCKLING:
OK, HOW 'BOUT...

53
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,276
ONCE A MONTH,
JUST US?

54
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,240
OK? THEN IT'S SETTLED.

55
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,248
ONCE A MONTH, BREAKFAST
WITH MY FAVOURITE TEAM.

56
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,532
LAURA: YEAH.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT. BRING IT IN.

57
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:04,318
LAURA: CHEERS.
BILLY: YEAH, BAKER BREAKFAST.

58
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:14,080
COOP: WAIT,
SO LIV DOESN'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS?

59
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,404
NAW, SHE WANTS TO BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

60
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,730
BRO, BUT Y'ALL
TRIED THAT ALREADY
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

61
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,536
"DIDN'T WORK" IS
A LITTLE OVERSIMPLIFIED,
BUT I GUESS.

62
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:22,940
NOW, LOOK, DO YOU
STILL LOVE LIV?

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,464
YES. BUT AM I STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER?

64
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:27,108
I DON'T KNOW.

65
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,354
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I FEEL
WHEN I'M AROUND HER

66
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:31,878
ISN'T JUST ECHOES
FROM WHAT WE HAD?

67
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:34,364
THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS.
WHAT DID ALICIA SAY?

68
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:35,968
SPENCER: 
COOP: ""?

69
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,812
WHAT DID YOUR
CURRENT GIRLFRIEND SAY

70
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:39,616
ABOUT YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND
WANTING YOU BACK?

71
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,260
SPENCER: I AIN'T TELL HER.
COOP: WHAT?

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,823
WHAT? LOOK, I'M TOO BUSY

73
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,426
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO SAY TO LIV,

74
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,990
WHO I'M KINDA
AVOIDING RIGHT NOW

75
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,674
'CAUSE SHE WANTS
TO MEET UP TODAY.

76
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,878
BRO, THERE'S WAY
TOO MUCH HISTORY
BETWEEN YOU TWO

77
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:52,524
FOR YOU TO JUST BE
BLOWING HER OFF
LIKE THAT, SO IF YOU

78
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:56,352
ARE GONNA AVOID HER,
YOU BETTER HAVE
A LEGIT REASON.

79
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,802
ARE YOU WEARING
A CARDIGAN?

80
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:12,768
NO, IT'S AN OFFICIAL
COASTAL CALIFORNIA
SWEATER VEST.

81
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,172
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR IT
TO THE COMBINE?

82
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,534
WELL, NOW I'M
NOT SO SURE.

83
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:18,902
IT'S FINE.
YOU LOOK COACH-Y.

84
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,906
ASHER: THAT'S WHAT
I WAS GOING FOR.
JAYMEE: GOOD, GOOD.

85
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,710
ASHER: ALL RIGHT.

86
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,474
WISH ME LUCK.

87
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,998
YOU'RE LEAVING
RIGHT NOW?

88
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,802
YEAH, IT'S--IT'S
A LONG DRIVE. WHY?

89
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,886
NOTHING. I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

90
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:32,112
ABOUT SOMETHING,
BUT IT CAN WAIT.

91
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,468
IS EVERYTHING OK?

92
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,114
I GUESS THAT DEPENDS
ON YOUR REACTION.

93
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,556
TO WHAT?

94
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,660
I'M PREGNANT.

95
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:51,814
NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR REACTION,
ASK ME AGAIN HOW I'M DOING.

96
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,420
NO, I'M--
I'M--I'M SORRY.

97
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,026
OK, UM...

98
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,990
LET ME CALL
THE OTHER COACHES,

99
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,994
LET 'EM KNOW THAT I CAN'T
COVER THE COMBINE, OK?

100
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:03,560
WE HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO TALK.

101
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,166
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT PLENTY, BUT

102
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,130
WE HAVE TIME.

103
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,616
YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE COMBINE,

104
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,222
WEAR YOUR LITTLE CARDIGAN.

105
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:15,908
ASHER: SWEATER VEST.
JAYMEE: HEH! YEAH. HEH!

106
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:18,092
WE CAN TALK
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

107
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,812
LAYLA: DAD.
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE IN TOWN.

108
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:30,460
HEY, UM, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
WITH MY DAUGHTER ALONE, PLEASE?

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,504
MAN: YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

110
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:33,827
OK.

111
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,872
WELL, I CAN TELL
YOU'RE UPSET,

112
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,876
BUT CAN I HUG YOU
AT LEAST?

113
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:40,020
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN MONTHS. HEH!

114
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,250
LOOK, I'M SURE
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

115
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,736
UM, 'CAUSE CLAY GAVE US
OUR NAME BACK?

116
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,944
EVERYTHING I BUILT
AT KEATING RECORDS,

117
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:55,034
MY LIFE'S WORK, IT'S GONE.
LAYLA: WELL, THE MUSIC
CATALOGUE'S STILL THERE.

118
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:58,160
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S
NAME ATTACHED TO IT.
IT WAS CREATED WITH MY NAME.

119
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,566
RIGHT. WELL, IF THE NAME
MEANT SO MUCH TO YOU,

120
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,612
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
LEFT IT TO SOMEONE
WHO SHARED THAT NAME.

121
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,616
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
YOUR LEGACY, DAD,

122
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,702
NOT CLAY,
AND I FIXED THAT.

123
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:10,428
HEY, I'M YOUR BLOOD
AND THE LEGACY
WILL CARRY ON.

124
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,432
YOU WERE SO ADAMANT
ABOUT WANTING TO BUILD
YOUR OWN THING, I DIDN'T

125
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,958
EVEN KNOW YOU WANTED
THE COMPANY, AND I
APOLOGISE FOR THAT.

126
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,924
BUT I WORKED REALLY HARD
TO BUILD KEATING RECORDS
FROM SCRATCH.

127
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:22,012
YES, YOU ARE MY LEGACY,
BUT SO IS THAT COMPANY,

128
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:25,661
AT LEAST UNTIL SOMEONE
STRIPPED MY NAME FROM IT.

129
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:28,507
SORRY.

130
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,874
ONE DAY
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

131
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,371
PREACH: A.J., WHERE YOU GOIN'?
A.J.: DETENTION.

132
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,576
PREACH: 
DETENTION IS THAT WAY.
A.J.: I'MMA HIT UP

133
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,941
THE CANDY MACHINE FIRST.
PREACH: THE CANDY MACHINE
IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE?

134
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:46,386
A.J.: AIN'T NO TEACHERS
HERE ON SATURDAY.
PREACH: I'M HERE.

135
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:49,794
LOOK, IT'S MY JOB TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET
TO DETENTION ON TIME,

136
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,682
BUT YOU GOT 20 SECONDS.
19, 18,

137
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,526
17.
AMINA: HI, DADDY.

138
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,892
AMINA, WHAT YOU DOIN' HERE?

139
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:00,096
I DON'T GET YOU
UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND.

140
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:03,504
MEMA DROPPED ME OFF
EARLY, SO WE CAN SPEND
THE WEEKEND TOGETHER.

141
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,468
NICE.
LOOK, I HAVE TO,

142
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,112
SUPERVISE THIS
DETENTION THING,

143
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,076
BUT YOU CAN HANG OUT
IN BILLY'S OFFICE.

144
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:10,600
COOP IS MEETING ME
HERE FOR LUNCH.

145
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,123
SHE'LL BE GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,368
COME HERE, BABY GIRL.

147
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,054
I MISS YOU.

148
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,898
WORKING
ANOTHER SATURDAY.

149
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,584
JUST DOING
SOME RESEARCH.

150
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,348
DID YOU HEAR
THE BIG NEWS?

151
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,352
OLIVIA: 
CHRISTEL: YOUR ARTICLE

152
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,878
HAS BEEN PICKED UP
IN 8 MAJOR NEWS MARKETS.

153
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,521
DETROIT, ATLANTA, PHILLY.

154
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,245
A LOCAL MORNING SHOW
IN CHICAGO IS EVEN

155
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,049
RUNNING AN ON-AIR
SEGMENT ABOUT IT.

156
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,334
OLIVIA: WAIT. SERIOUSLY?
CHRISTEL: CONGRATULATIONS.

157
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,619
IT'S TOO BAD I HAD TO
TURN DOWN THE INTERVIEW,

158
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,746
BUT THIS IS STILL
HUGE FOR YOU, AND US.

159
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:43,272
WAIT--WHAT--
WHAT INTERVIEW?

160
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,076
THEY WANTED TO TALK
TO THE JOURNALIST

161
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:46,920
WHO WROTE THE ARTICLE--
JAYDEN DAVIS.

162
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,004
TSK.

163
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,810
SUCKS THAT I DON'T
GET ANY CREDIT
FOR MY OWN ARTICLE.

164
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,015
YOU CHOSE TO GO

168
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:09,168

00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,253
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

170
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,818
LAYLA: I GUESS TALK TO CLAY.
JORDAN:.

171
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,384
I--I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF YOU HAVING TO GROVEL.

172
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:19,030
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT GROVELING?

173
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,353
NOT ME.

174
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,876
YEAH, I DON'T GROVEL.

175
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,840
JORDAN: OF COURSE NOT.
LAYLA: YEAH. HEH!

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,524
JORDAN: YOU DON'T GROVEL. NO.

JORDAN: ACTUALLY, YO, SPENCE.
SPENCER: YEAH?

185
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,076
I AM HELPING OUT AT
THE SPRING COMBINE TODAY.

186
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,440
YOU KNOW, JUST GIVING
SOME HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS

187
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,083
A CHANCE TO SHINE.
DON'T SUPPOSE MAYBE

188
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:44,646
YOU'D WANT TO PITCH IN AND--
SPENCER: YES.

189
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,050
YES, DEFINITELY.
LET'S DO IT.

190
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,615
REALLY? OK, THAT WAS
UNEXPECTEDLY EASY.

191
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,540
WELL, I KINDA NEED
SOMETHING LEGIT
TO DO TODAY

192
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,704
TO GET OUT
OF SOMETHING ELSE,
SO THIS IS PERFECT.

193
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,868
MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU REALLY WANT
TO GET OUT OF BADLY

194
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:57,034
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO SPEND TIME WITH MY DAD.

195
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:59,439
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT SPENDING TIME
WITH YOUR DAD? NO.

196
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:01,644
NO, IT'S A BIG FIELD,
AND I'M THERE

197
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:04,390
FOR THE PLAYERS,
NOT HIM. COME ON.

198
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:07,878
OK.

199
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,554
BILLY: HEY, ASH.
ASHER: HEH!

200
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,558
BILLY: WHAT'S UP?
ASHER: HEY, COACH.

201
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,523
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO THE COMBINE?

202
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:22,008
YEAH. YEAH, I'M--
I'M ON MY WAY
THERE NOW.

203
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:25,376
BILLY: OK.
ASHER: I JUST WANTED
TO GET SOME ADVICE.

204
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,781
OH. OK.
CAN WE DISCUSS IT
AT THE COMBINE?

205
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,427
MY GIRLFRIEND IS
PREGNANT, COACH.

206
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,474
BILLY: OK.

207
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,558
WOW.

208
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,763
THAT IS THE FIRST TIME

209
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:40,128
THAT I'VE
SAID IT OUT LOUD.
IT FEELS--

210
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,255
BILLY: HEH HEH!
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT.
ASHER: COACH, I HAVE...

211
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,260
A HUNDRED QUESTIONS

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,224
AND NOT ONE
SINGLE ANSWER.

213
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:49,710
BILLY: YOU'LL BE READY.
ASHER: HOW DO YOU KNOW?

214
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,716
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE MOST
PREPARED PLAYER
I'VE EVER COACHED,

215
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:55,462
SO, WE'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

216
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:58,810
OK?

217
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,014
NOW, WE GONNA GO
TO THIS COMBINE

218
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,139
OR WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT YOUR KID ALL DAY?

219
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,742
YEAH, SORRY.

220
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,028
BILLY: OK.
ASHER: HEH!

221
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,272
I'LL, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
BILLY: OK, YEAH.

222
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,678
ALL RIGHT, UM,
THAT'S THE KITCHEN,
IT'S THAT DIRECTION.

223
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:15,726
SO YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
TO DRIVE, SO WHY DON'T WE
TAKE THE CRENSHAW BUS TOGETHER?

224
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,370
ASHER: YEAH.
BILLY: YEAH. THERE WE GO.

225
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,374
ASHER: YEAH, THANKS.
BILLY: THIS WAY.

226
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,339
OPEN UP. THERE WE GO.
ASHER: YEAH.

227
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,303
YO, WHERE DID YOU
GET THESE?

228
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:25,228
WE GOT A SNACK MACHINE
IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.

229
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:27,272
DAWG, I JUST
BROKE MY TOOTH.

230
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:29,236
THIS THING GOTTA BE,
LIKE, 30 YEARS OLD.

231
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,562
AMINA: TASTES GOOD TO ME.
COOP: WELL, THEN, SEE HERE.

232
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:34,488
YOU CAN HAVE MINE THEN.
WOMAN: AMINA.

233
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,058
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
EATING THAT MUCH SUGAR?

234
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,062
YOU SAID IT'LL
ROT MY TEETH.

235
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,147
YOU NEED
SOMETHING,
MRS. MOORE?

236
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,191
YES. I NEED
MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

237
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,599
ARE YOU FORGETTING WE HAVE
FULL CUSTODY OF HER?
THIS WAS STUPID.

238
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:51,445
WHY DID YOU DROP HER OFF
EARLY IF YOU WAS GONNA
COME AT HIM LIKE THIS?

239
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,209
THE JUDGE IS GONNA
HEAR ABOUT THIS.

240
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,973
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

241
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,696
I RAN AWAY.

242
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,902
COOP: WAIT. WHAT?
AMINA: I'M SORRY, MEMA.

243
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,347
I LIED AND SAID YOU
DROPPED ME OFF EARLY
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT

244
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,512
TO MOVE TO BALTIMORE.
COOP: BALTIMORE?

245
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,276
AIN'T NOBODY GOIN'
TO BALTIMORE.

246
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,120
WE ARE.
WE'RE MOVING THERE

247
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,044
AT THE END OF AMINA'S
SCHOOL SEMESTER.

248
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,449
THE HELL YOU ARE.

249
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,376
AMINA, LET'S GO
CHECK OUT THE GYM.

250
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,420
IS THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU GET ALL TOUGH

251
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,825
AND YOU TRY TO
INTIMIDATE ME?

252
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,672
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

253
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,676
AMINA'S
OUR RESPONSIBILITY,

254
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,680
AND SHE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

255
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,248
I KNOW THE REAL YOU.
I WATCHED YOU GROW UP
ON THESE STREETS,

256
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:32,375
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M TAKING HER
FAR AWAY FROM HERE,

257
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,121
AND NOW YOU DON'T
GET HER NEXT WEEKEND.

258
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,834
JORDAN:
OK, SO REWIND.

259
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,038
MY SISTER ASKED YOU
TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

260
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:45,684
SPENCER: YEP.
JORDAN: AND YOU
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

261
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,728
SHE AIN'T GIVE ME
A CHANCE.

262
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,573
BUT SHE WANTED
TO TALK TODAY
AND INSTEAD,

263
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,256
YOU'RE DOING THE COMBINE?
SPENCER: BRO,

264
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:53,582
YOU ASKED ME
FOR MY HELP.

265
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:56,027
NAH. YOU ARE JUST
AVOIDING HER.
THAT IS NOT COOL.

266
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,074
SPENCER: WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON, DAWG?
JORDAN: MY SISTER'S.

267
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,158
OK, LOOK, COOL.

268
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,162
YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE, I'LL LEAVE.
JORDAN: NO, NO, NO, NO.

269
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,969
COME ON. WE'RE ALREADY
HERE, ALL RIGHT?
BESIDES, YOU PROBABLY

270
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,735
ALREADY BLEW IT
WITH LIV, BUT MY DAD WAS
GLAD YOU AGREED TO COME.

271
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,782
SPENCER: WHY'D YOU TELL HIM?
JORDAN: 'CAUSE IT WAS HIS IDEA.

272
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,946
HE ASKED YOU
TO BRING ME HERE?

273
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,712
I MEAN, HE MENTIONED IT.
IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS
SOME DEVIOUS PLAN.

274
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,516
BRO, NOW HE'S GONNA
THINK I'M ACCEPTING

275
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,320
SOME OLIVE BRANCH THAT
I AIN'T READY FOR YET.

276
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,924
YOU GOTTA RELAX,
DUDE, OK?

277
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,008
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS
MAKING EVERYTHING

278
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,316
MORE COMPLICATED HERE,
ALL RIGHT, WITH OLIVIA
AND MY DAD.

279
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:33,770
I'MMA GO CHECK OUT
THESE WIDE RECEIVERS.

280
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,743
I...

281
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,936
CLAY, CHUCKLING:
YEAH, THIS LOOKS GOOD.
I LIKE THAT.

282
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,943
YOU DIDN'T
WASTE ANY TIME.

283
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,950
REBRANDING IS OUR
MAIN FOCUS RIGHT NOW.

284
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,398
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LAYLA: CLAY TAYLOR
ENTERTAINMENT?

285
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,003
YOU REALLY GOING
WITH THE INITIALS?
CLAY: IT'S OUR NEW LOGO. WHY?

286
00:11:58,104 --> 00:11:59,847
LAYLA: CTE?
CLAY:

287
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:01,772
YOU KNOW THAT'S
A SPORTS INJURY-RELATED

288
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:02,974
BRAIN CONDITION, RIGHT?

289
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,658
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

290
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,103
YES, ACTUALLY.
GOOD NEWS.

291
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,588
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE THE CTE LOGO.

292
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,794
IT'S CLAY TAYLOR
ENTERTAINMENT.

293
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,279
LAYLA: NO, IT'S KEATING RECORDS.
CLAY: WHAT?

294
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,324
YOU CAN HAVE
THE NAME BACK.

295
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:18,288
I WAS WRONG.

296
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:20,492
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU WERE WRONG,

297
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:22,658
OR DID DADDY SAY
YOU WERE WRONG?

298
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,263
DOES IT MATTER?
YOU CAN HAVE
THE NAME BACK.

299
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:29,072
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU WIN.
CLAY: I ALREADY WON.

300
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,517
I GOT THE ARTISTS,
THE CATALOGUE,
AND THE EMPIRE.

301
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,162
NOW IT'S ALL UNDER MY NAME.
LAYLA: CTE.

302
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:36,368
IT'S CLAY TAYLOR
ENTERTAI--

303
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:39,254
LOOK, THE BALL IS
ALREADY ROLLING
ON THIS REBRANDING.

304
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,499
IT'S TOO LATE,
SO YOU CAN KEEP
THE KEATING NAME.

305
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,744
NOW GO WORK
ON THEM DADDY ISSUES
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

306
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:46,710
I HAVE AN EMPIRE
TO RUN HERE.

307
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,356
D, LET ME HOLLER
AT YOU RIGHT QUICK.
THIS LOOKS GOOD, MAN.

308
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,864
MAYBE WE CAN GET
ANOTHER SIGN RIGHT HERE...

309
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,211
CRENSHAW GOT SOME
CRAZY TALENT
COMING BACK

310
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,536
NEXT YEAR, COACH.
BILLY: HEH HEH! YES, SIR.

311
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,581
SHAME I AIN'T GONNA BE
OUT THERE WITH 'EM.

312
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,665
OH, COME ON, NOW.

313
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,870
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE BALLIN'
OUT THERE AT COASTAL.

314
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,356
JABARI: 
BILLY: ONLY BIGGER AND
BETTER THINGS FOR YOU, SON.

315
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,160
JABARI: WHAT ABOUT YOU?
BILLY:

316
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,204
BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS
IN YOUR FUTURE, TOO?

317
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:13,248
THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE
ABOUT YOU LEAVING...
BILLY: YEAH.

318
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,253
SO GUYS ARE STARTING
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

319
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:16,856
BILLY: I'MMA TELL
THE TEAM TODAY.
JABARI: WELL, WHATEVER

320
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:19,422
YOU DECIDE, COACH,
I GOT YOUR BACK

321
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:22,308
'CAUSE, I MEAN,
WITHOUT YOU...

322
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,954
IF I DIDN'T
COME PLAY FOR YOU,

323
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,602
THERE WOULD BE NO BIGGER
AND BETTER IN MY FUTURE.

324
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,647
COME ON, MAN.

325
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:33,012
I'LL NEVER FORGET
EVERYTHING YOU DID
FOR ME, COACH.

326
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,618
I APPRECIATE THAT.

327
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:38,023
THANK YOU, SON.

328
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:40,028

329
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:44,878
HEY, COACH.

00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:46,682
OH, IT'S MY HUSBAND'S
ACE RECRUITER.

331
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,406
HEH HEH.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

332
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,410
I MEAN, YOU WERE
MY SECRET WEAPON

333
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,615
AND NOW YOU'RE HIS.
ASHER, CHUCKLING: YEAH, RIGHT.

334
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,780
YOU JUST HAD
ANOTHER GREAT SEASON
AT BEVERLY WITHOUT ME.

335
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,027
AH, WELL, WHEN YOU
WERE BY MY SIDE, IT WAS
DEFINITELY A LOT EASIER.

336
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,713
ASHER: I DO WANT
TO KNOW YOUR SECRET.
MONTES: TO COACHING?

337
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,757
ASHER: YES.
MONTES: HYDRATION.

338
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:05,283
ASHER: SUCH A MONTES ANSWER.

339
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,568
BILLY: OH, WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?
ASHER: COACH.

340
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,652
BILLY: BEVERLY REUNION

341
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:11,898
MONTES: HEY, COACH.
BILLY: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

342
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,421
SO, HOW'S...

343
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,864
HOW'S MY OLD OFFICE?

344
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:16,828
JUST KEEP ADDING
BANNERS TO IT.

345
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,634
I WAS JUST ASKING
MONTES HER SECRET
TO COACHING.

346
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,639
WHAT'S YOURS?

347
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,804
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
MY SECRETS.

348
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,928
WE'RE RIVALS
NEXT YEAR, BRUH.

349
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,173
YEAH.
ASHER: YEAH. I, 
I KEEP FORGETTING.

350
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:30,418
BILLY: YUP.

351
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:33,385
LOOK, UM...

352
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:35,910
I WANT YOU BOTH

YOU'VE MEANT TO ME.

353
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,877
YOU BOTH HELPED ME
BECOME THE PERSON
THAT I AM TODAY.

354
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,881
NOW I'M--I'M
GONNA WALK AWAY

355
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,206
'CAUSE I KNOW MONTES
HATES THESE MOMENTS.
BILLY: HA HA!

356
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:47,095
I DO, BUT, 
THANK YOU, COACH ADAMS.

357
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,139
ASHER: WELCOME.
BILLY: THANK YOU, SIR.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

358
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:52,988
SO THE RUMOURS
ARE TRUE.

359
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,473
YOU AND ADAMS ARE GONNA
BE RIVALS NEXT YEAR?

360
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,478
YEAH, YEAH.

361
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:59,883
I, HAVEN'T...

362
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,489
HAVEN'T TOLD
MY TEAM YET.

363
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:04,974
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOUR
NEXT STEP IS GONNA BE?

364
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:08,261
BEVERLY IS
MY NEXT STEP.

365
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:11,188
I MEAN, LOOK AT WHAT
WE GET TO DO.

366
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:13,312
I LOVE THIS.

367
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,758
AND THESE KIDS NEED US,
THEY LOOK UP TO US,

368
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,762
AND THEY STILL LOVE
FOOTBALL.

369
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,528
YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE ASSUME
THAT I HAVEN'T APPLIED

370
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,495
TO A D-1 JOB BECAUSE
I'M A WOMAN, BUT,

371
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:27,944
REALLY,
IT'S BECAUSE...I'M
RIGHT WHERE I BELONG.

372
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,432
DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS,

373
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,038
AND I'M SURE THAT YOU
HAVE YOUR REASONS
FOR MOVING ON,

374
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:37,205
BUT...I'D BE CRAZY
TO LEAVE.

375
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:40,612
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT COACH AT GAU,

376
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,258
BUT YOU'RE A GREAT MAN
IN CRENSHAW.

377
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,405
YOU'D BE INSANE
TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT.

378
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:52,681
NICE GRAB, NICE GRAB,
NICE GRAB.

379
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:55,167

00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,656
YOU OUT THERE DROPPING
EASY PASSES AND LAUGHING?

387
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:19,500
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT
HAVING STONE HANDS, BRUH?

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,304
YO, YOU AIN'T GOTTA DO ME
LIKE THAT, BIG DAWG.

389
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,469
I DROPPED A PASS.
I'LL CATCH THE NEXT ONE.
NO BIG DEAL.

390
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,794
NO, NO, IT IS A BIG DEAL.
IT AIN'T ABOUT

391
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,841
THE DROPPED BALL, MAN.
IT'S ABOUT YOU SHOWING
ALL THOSE COLLEGE COACHES

392
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,607
THAT YOU DON'T CARE.
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
YOU GOT BIG TALENT.

393
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,493
DO NOT GIVE THESE COACHES
A REASON TO PASS ON YOU,
MAN. COME ON.

394
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,638
EDDY: YES, SIR.
SPENCER: LET'S GO.

395
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,270
EVERYBODY, IT'S
SPENCER JAMES.

396
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,355
HA HA HA HA!

397
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:45,958
MAN, I JUST HAD

398
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:48,163
A VERY SCARY FLASHBACK
TO YOU GETTING ON ME

399
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:50,208
AT PRACTICE.
SPENCER: HEY,

400
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:52,212
OH...
SO YOU TAKING

401
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,256

402
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,662
NAH.
NO, YOU EARNED THAT.

403
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:59,067
YOU DEFINITELY
HELPED, THOUGH.

404
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,112
SPENCER: 
JABARI: THAT'S FOR SURE.

405
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,156
MAN, YOU LUCKY.

406
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,524
YOU GET TO BE REUNITED
WITH COACH BAKER
AT GAU NEXT YEAR.

407
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:08,668
YEAH, BUT AT WHAT COST?

408
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,176
LOOK, IF YOU ASK ME,

409
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,779
COASTAL'S THE LUCKY ONE.

410
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,984
THEY GOT THEMSELVES A STAR.

411
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,470
BUT YOU KNOW WE GONNA
HAVE TO PLAY EACH OTHER
NEXT YEAR, RIGHT?

412
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,514
YEAH, OCTOBER 7.

413
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,559

00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,525
JABARI: OH, IT'S BEEN CIRCLED.
SPENCER: HA HA HA!

415
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,852
JABARI:

SPENCER: BOY, I STAY READY.

416
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:32,500
JABARI: I HOPE SO.
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRO.
SPENCER: PROUD OF YOU, MAN.

417
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,425
HEY, THANK YOU.

418
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,229
LET'S GO, 14.
SPENCER: AH!

419
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,832
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
JABARI: GOOD STUFF.

420
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,097
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, EDDY.

421
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,821
SADIE MOORE: TAMIA.
COOP: HEY, MS. MOORE.

422
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,785
WHERE'S YOUR MUM?

423
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,391
COOP: SHE AIN'T COMIN'.
SADIE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

424
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,037
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HER. SHE TOLD ME TO
MEET HER HERE FOR COFFEE.

425
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,803
I ASKED HER TO DO THAT
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T MEET WITH ME.

426
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:04,571
TAMIA, I KNOW WHAT YOU
GONNA SAY, AND IT
AIN'T GONNA WORK.

427
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,856
CAN WE PLEASE JUST
HAVE THE COFFEE?

428
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,021
ALL RIGHT, I ORDERED
YOURS ALREADY.
SADIE:.

429
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,664
AND THEN YOU CAN CALL
AND YELL AT MY MUM LATER.

430
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,348
OH, I'LL CALL HER.

431
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,493
SHE'LL PROBABLY BE
WAITING ON IT.

432
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,123
SO...

433
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,330
SHE TOLD ME YOU WERE
WORKING IN A LAW FIRM?

434
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,254
YEAH. I AM.

435
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,259
YOU HAVE REALLY TURNED
YOUR LIFE AROUND?

436
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,424
I HAVE,
AND SO HAS PREACH.

437
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,147
WE'RE MOVING
TO BALTIMORE, TAMIA.

438
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,192
OK, BUT DON'T MOVE
BECAUSE YOU THINK

439
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,757
YOU'RE PROTECTING AMINA
FROM HER DAD, ALL RIGHT?

440
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,283
NOT UNTIL YOU GET
TO KNOW THE REAL PREACH.

441
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,648
OH, I KNOW HIM.
I WATCHED HIM GROW UP.

442
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,652
AND YOU WATCHED ME
GROW UP, AND YOU JUST SAID

443
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:44,298
YOURSELF I WAS ABLE
TO TURN MY LIFE AROUND.

444
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:47,124
WHY ARE YOU SO SURE
HE CAN'T TURN HIS AROUND?

445
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,937
YOU GONNA TALK TO HIM?

446
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,581
I ALREADY DID
THE OTHER DAY.

447
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:05,585
AIN'T NOTHING
LEFT TO SAY.

448
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,870
IF THAT WAS TRUE,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

449
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,514
I'M JUST HELPING OUT

450
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,320
AND AVOIDING LIV.
GRACE: WHY?

451
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,685
SPENCER: SHE WANTS
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.
GRACE: IS THAT A BAD THING?

452
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,649
I DON'T KNOW YET.

453
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,416
I MEAN,
WHAT'S REALLY CHANGED
SINCE WE BROKE UP, MA?

454
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:22,502
YOU HAVE.
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
AS HAPPY, BABY.

455
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,308
I'M JUST
ACKNOWLEDGING A FACT.

456
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:28,195
GRACE: OK.

457
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,279
I'MMA LET YOU
SIT WITH THAT,

458
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,126
BUT AS FOR BILLY--
SPENCER: WHY'D YOU
FORGIVE HIM SO EASY?

459
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:35,772
FIRST OFF, BILLY DIDN'T
NEED MY FORGIVENESS.

460
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,377
I MEAN, I CONFRONTED HIM,
I SPOKE MY PIECE,

461
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,584
WE'RE MOVING ON.
YOU AIN'T GONNA BE
DIVIDED FOREVER.

462
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,591
SPENCER: LOOK, I TOLD YOU,
I ALREADY SAID MY PIECE, MA.
GRACE: DID YOU?

463
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,339
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU
MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE MORE
THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

464
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,969
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

465
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,935
UM, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GREAT.

466
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:16,461
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I
WANTED TO HEAR. HEH HEH!

467
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,470
UM, NOW CAN I SAY
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
NOT WANT TO HEAR?

468
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,837
HEY, UM, I JUST FEEL
LIKE IT'S MISSING
SOMETHING.

469
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:26,363
SOME OF THE LEVELS
ARE A BIT ROUGH.

470
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,527
YOU KNOW, I'D--I'D JUST
GET RID OF THE FLUFF,

471
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,692
AND IT FEELS A BIT
CROWDED. I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED TO FILL

472
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,737
ALL THAT SPACE 'CAUSE
HER VOICE IS SO STRONG.

473
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,100
ANYTHING ELSE?

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,984
UM, WELL, THE REVERB

475
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:38,149
AT THE BEGINNING
HAS GOTTA GO.

476
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:40,353
I MEAN, YOU COULD--YOU
COULD ADD SOME COMPRESSION
IN A FEW SPOTS

477
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,558
OR TRY IT AND SEE
WHERE IT GETS YOU.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

478
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,042
WE CAN EVEN ADD SOME
NOW IF YOU'VE GOT TIME.

479
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,685
YES, PLEASE, YEAH.

480
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,808
LAYLA: OK. DAD.
JP: HEY. THIS A BAD TIME?

481
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,531
HI. UM, YOU KNOW

482
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:50,416
SHAWN STOCKMAN.
JP: OH, HEY, IT'S BEEN A WHILE,

483
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,260
BUT WE GO WAY BACK. COME ON.
SHAWN: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

484
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,863
JP, CHUCKLING:
HEY, HEY.

485
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,386
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
THIS GUY TURNED ME DOWN?

486
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:56,830
IT WAS NEVER
REALLY THE RIGHT TIME.

487
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,914
JP: YEAH, RIGHT.
SHAWN: HA HA HA!

488
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:01,360
JP: HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?
SHAWN: ACTUALLY, I'M HERE

489
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,765
TO TEST YOUR DAUGHTER OUT, MAN.
SHE'S MAKING A HELL OF A NAME
FOR HERSELF,

490
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:05,569
AND NOW I BELIEVE
THE HYPE.

491
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,014
LAYLA: SO YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS MISSING.
SHAWN: HEH!

492
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,580
I DID, UM, AND I
NEEDED YOU TO HEAR
THE SAME THING,

493
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,825
THAT IS, IF WE'RE GONNA
PRODUCE THIS SONG TOGETHER.

494
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:16,553
WAIT. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU--YOU WANT TO
PRODUCE WITH ME?

495
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,076
SHAWN: LISTEN.
I'VE SENT THIS SONG

496
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,482
TO ABOUT
20 PRODUCERS OR MORE,

497
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:22,727
AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY
CRITICISED IT?

498
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:23,969
JUST YOU.

499
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,332
I DON'T NEED
SOMEONE TO TELL ME

500
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:27,136
THAT THE SONG
IS GOOD.

501
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,101
I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME
MAKE THE SONG GREAT.

502
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,305
WELL, I'M IN,
AND I'M HONOURED. HEH!

503
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:34,593
UM, DAD, CAN WE
TALK LATER? I'LL JUST--
JP: HEY, DO YOUR THING.

504
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,357
HEY, SHAWN,
IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU, BRO.
SHAWN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, BRO.

505
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:37,880
JP: ALL RIGHT. COOL.
SHAWN: ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE.

506
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,804
UM, OK. I JUST WANT
TO LISTEN TO IT

507
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,889
ONE MORE TIME AND
THEN TRY SOME THINGS.

508
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,492
SHAWN: YEAH. LET'S DO IT.
LAYLA: OK, GREAT.

509
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,140
OH.

510
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,784
SPENCER: I GOT TO
GET GOING. YOU GOOD?

511
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,788
YEAH, YEAH.
I'LL FIND A RIDE.

512
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:52,793
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

513
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:54,997
COACH, YOU GOT A SECOND?

514
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,002
BILLY: YEAH.

515
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,006
I GOT TO GET GOING.

516
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:02,093
OK, WELL, 
THANKS FOR COMING OUT,

517
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:04,338
HELPING WITH THE,
WIDE RECEIVERS.

518
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:05,621
APPRECIATE THAT.

519
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,224
LOT OF TALENT
ON THIS FIELD.

520
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,908
YEAH.

521
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,113
IT'S GONNA BE
A BRIGHT FUTURE.

522
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,859
LOOK, I STAND
BY WHAT I SAID.

523
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,770
YOU'D BE CRAZY TO LEAVE
SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH,

524
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,774
BUT IF YOU'RE
GONNA DO IT,

525
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,099
JUST RIP THE
BAND-AID OFF, MAN.

526
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,144
WORKING WITH
YOUR PLAYERS TODAY,
THEY SO EXCITED

527
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,148
ABOUT NEXT SEASON,
EVEN TALKING 'BOUT

528
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:30,155
GETTING THEIR COACH
ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP.

529
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:33,121
THEY GONNA TAKE IT HARD,
KNOWING YOU'RE LEAVING,

530
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,166
AND THE LONGER YOU WAIT,
THE HARDER IT'S GONNA BE.

531
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,172
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I, WAS GONNA
TELL 'EM TODAY,

532
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,778
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA
NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME

533
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:43,103
'CAUSE MY HEAD'S BEEN
SWIRLING ALL AROUND.

534
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,827
IT'S NEVER GONNA BE
THE RIGHT TIME.

535
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,350
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE BLINDSIDED.

536
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,555
DO NOT DO THAT
TO THESE KIDS.

537
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,880
THEY GOT ENOUGH OBSTACLES
THEY GOTTA FACE.

538
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,286
THEY DON'T NEED THE MAN
THEY LOOK UP TO MOST

539
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:56,172
STRINGING THEM ALONG,
ACTING LIKE HE ALWAYS
GONNA BE THERE FOR 'EM.

540
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,276
YEAH.

541
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,684
SO WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND ME?

542
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,916
I NEED TIME.

543
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:08,920
I JUST NEED MORE TIME.

544
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,024
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

545
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:18,381
COME ON, MAN!

546
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,305
A.J.: BITCH, I WILL
RIP YOUR HAIR OUT.

547
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:22,309
GIRL: GIRL, GET
YOUR HANDS UP OFF ME!

548
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,196
PREACH: WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

549
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:28,443
WHAT THE HELL? I KNOW
Y'ALL NOT FIGHTING
IN MY HALLWAY!

550
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,287
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?!
A.J.: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

551
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:31,890
I WAS JUST TAKING
OUT THE TRASH.

552
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,735
LOOK, Y'ALL CAN'T BE
FIGHTING IN HERE.

553
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:35,338
A.J.: THEN WE CAN GO OUTSIDE.
PREACH: LOOK, IF I REPORT

554
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:37,503
THIS, YOU'RE BOTH
GETTING EXPELLED.

555
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:40,269
A.J.: HEH! WE KNOW YOU
AIN'T REPORTING NOTHING.
PREACH: WHY WON'T I?

556
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,113
MY BROTHER SAYS NOBODY
MESSES WITH PREACH.

557
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,957
YOU WAS IN PRISON,
RIGHT?

558
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,841
PREACH: SEE, WHAT YOUR BROTHER
SHOULD BE SAYING IS I'M

559
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,926
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SOMEONE CAN
TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND.

560
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,529
IT AIN'T ABOUT
THAT LIFE NO MORE.

561
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,333
I GOT
A DAUGHTER NOW,

562
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,338
A FEW YEARS YOUNGER
THAN BOTH OF YOU,

563
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,342
AND I'LL TELL HER
LIKE I'MMA TELL YOU.

564
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:57,346
NO ONE CAN MAKE
YOUR LIFE EASIER,

565
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:59,631
BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT
HARDER.

566
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,636
A.J.: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
PREACH: IT MEANS NOBODY'S GONNA

567
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:04,602
OPEN THE DOORS FOR YOU,
BUT IF Y'ALL KEEP
ACTING LIKE THIS,

568
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:08,050
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE
THAT CAN'T WAIT TO CLOSE
THE DOOR IN YOUR FACE.

569
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,575
LOOK, STOP ACTING LIKE FOOLS
AND STOP FIGHTING,

570
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:13,442
AND YOU'RE GOOD.
NOW GET YOUR BAGS.

571
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:19,154
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
GATHER ROUND. BRING IT IN.

572
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:22,161
BRING IT IN.
BRING IT IN.

573
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,765
ALL RIGHT.

574
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,849
HA HA HA!
LOOK AT Y'ALL.

575
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:29,217
I GOTTA SAY, I'M PROUD
OF Y'ALL EFFORT OUT THERE.

576
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,582
Y'ALL DID Y'ALL THINGS IN FRONT
OF THOSE COLLEGE COACHES,

577
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,746
AND BELIEVE ME,
THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY

578
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,192
TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS
WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR FUTURE.

579
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,357
I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE

580
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:41,483
OF YOUR SENIOR SEASONS,
Y'ALL GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

581
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:44,009
GIVE YOURSELVES A HAND,
ALL RIGHT?

582
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,052
PLAYERS: YEAH.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT.

583
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:48,018
THAT BEING SAID,

584
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,263
I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE
BEEN A LOT OF RUMOURS

585
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,869
FLOATING AROUND
'BOUT MY FUTURE,

586
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,594
AND I JUST WANTED Y'ALL
TO HEAR IT FROM ME.

587
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,879
THOSE RUMOURS ARE TRUE.

588
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,325
I HAVE BEEN OFFERED
THE HEAD-COACHING POSITION

589
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,329
AT GAU,

590
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:04,855
AND, UM--
AND I'VE ACCEPTED IT...

591
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,501
PLAYERS:...
BILLY: BUT HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
I AIN'T DONE, I AIN'T DONE.

592
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:11,589
I HAVE ALSO BEEN DOING
SOME SOUL-SEARCHING
THE PAST COUPLE DAYS,

593
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,795
AND...

594
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,601
AFTER SEEING WHAT Y'ALL
WERE DOING OUT THERE
ON THAT FIELD TODAY,

595
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:19,126
WORKING HARD AS HELL
TO MAKE CRENSHAW

596
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,091
A BETTER TEAM NEXT YEAR,

597
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:24,658
I REALIZED I MADE
A MISTAKE. YEAH.

598
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:28,467
SOMEBODY REALLY CLOSE TO ME
JUST TOLD ME THAT I WOULD BE
CRAZY TO LEAVE CRENSHAW,

599
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:31,874
TO LEAVE THE MAN
THAT CRENSHAW MADE ME,
AND HE WAS RIGHT.

600
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:35,643
JABARI: SO YOU STAYING, COACH?
BILLY: I'M SAYING I'M RIGHT
HERE WHERE I BELONG.

601
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,847
PLAYERS: YEAH!

602
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:40,473
WHOO!

603
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,629
HEY, THINK FAST, OLD MAN.

604
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,192
BILLY: HA!
JORDAN: OOH!

605
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,916
BILLY: "OLD MAN"? HA HA HA!
JORDAN: YEP.

606
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,562
OOH, THAT'S
A LITTLE WOBBLY.

607
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:54,885
BILLY: HA HA HA!
JORDAN: AND YOU'RE THE ONE

608
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:56,408
WHO TAUGHT ME HOW
TO THROW A SPIRAL.

609
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,413
OH, I'VE NEVER HAD
YOUR ARM, THOUGH.

610
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,096
YEAH, BUT YOU HAD
SOME WHEELS.

611
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:01,900
I DID HAVE WHEELS.

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,905
YOU KNOW, THAT SPEECH
WAS A SURPRISE.

613
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,109
OH, NOW, YEAH, I'M
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SON.

614
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,875
NAH, COME ON.
YOU DON'T GOT TO APOLOGISE.

615
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:11,080
I WILL BE FINE.
WHEN YOU LEFT BEVERLY,

616
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,085
I HAD COACH MONTES,
AND THERE'S GONNA BE

617
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,129
PLENTY OF COACHES
IN MY FUTURE,

618
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:17,053
BUT ONLY ONE DAD.

619
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:18,857
HA HA HA!

620
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,822
YEAH.

621
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:23,828
I ACTUALLY CHANGED
MY MIND

622
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:27,075
IN THE MOMENT...'CAUSE I
HAD BEEN STRUGGLING

623
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:29,681
WITH WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, AND

624
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,409
THEN I SAW WHAT
THE BOYS WERE DOING OUT
THERE, AND I REALISED--

625
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,055
- YOU'RE RIGHT WHERE YOU BELONG.
- YEAH.

626
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,182
I LOVED HEARING THAT.
IT MADE ME HAPPY.

627
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:42,189
LOOK...IF YOU WANT
TO RE-ENTER

628
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,434
THE TRANSFER PORTAL,
I CAN MAKE A COUPLE

629
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,518
OF CALLS
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I PUT
YOU IN A BAD POSITION.

630
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:49,445
NAH, NAH, NAH.
I THINK I'M RIGHT
WHERE I BELONG, TOO.

631
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:51,890
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU DO SEEM HAPPIER

632
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,696
THAN I'VE SEEN YOU NOW
IN A LONG TIME.

633
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:57,061
YEAH, LOVE CAN
DO THAT TO YOU.

634
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,106
JORDAN: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
BILLY: COME ON, MAN.

635
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:03,115
YOU HAVE THE WORST
POKER FACE EVER,
ESPECIALLY WITH ME.

636
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:06,201
OH, THE BUS IS ABOUT
TO LEAVE. LOOK,
YOU TELL LAYLA...

637
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:08,687
SHE OFFICIALLY
HAS MY APPROVAL.

638
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:10,771
NOW, HOW DID YOU--
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

639
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:12,615
I'M YOUR FATHER.

640
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,259
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

641
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,903
BRING IT IN.
LOVE YOU, TOO.

642
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,270
- HERE YOU GO.
- SEE YOU IN A BIT.

643
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,315
YEP. HIGH
AND TIGHT, NOW.

644
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:22,958
HA HA!

645
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,063
HA HA HA!

646
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,074
HEY, YOU
STILL BUSY?

647
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:41,479
HI. UM, I AM
ALWAYS BUSY.

648
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,764
HOW DID YOU LINK UP
WITH SHAWN ANYWAY?

649
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,209
LAYLA: A FRIEND OF A FRIEND.
JP: AND DID YOU TELL HIM

650
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,414
YOU USED TO HAVE
A BOYZ II MEN POSTER
GROWING UP?

651
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:50,379
LAYLA: UM...
JP: NO.

652
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,423
JP: LOOK, UM,

653
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:54,467
LAYLA--
LAYLA: CLAY SAID NO, DAD.

654
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:58,477
I TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE
THE KEATING NAME BACK,
AND HE SAID NO,

655
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:02,405
SO I KNOW YOU WANTED ME
TO FIX IT, BUT I CAN'T.
SORRY.

656
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,249
JP: I'M GLAD.
LAYLA: YOU'RE GLAD I'M SORRY?

657
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,013
NO, I'M GLAD YOU
COULDN'T FIX IT.

658
00:28:06,113 --> 00:28:07,697
HE DIDN'T DESERVE
OUR NAME ANYWAY.

659
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,142
LAYLA: AM I MISSING SOMETHING?
JP: YOU KNOW,

660
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,547
SOMETIMES
I FORGET YOU'RE
ONLY 19 YEARS OLD.

661
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,193
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
DOING WHEN I WAS 19?
NOT THIS,

662
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,197
NOT BUILDING
AN EMPIRE.

663
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:20,204
I WAS WASHING DISHES
AT A 24-HOUR DINER.

664
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:23,932
I MEAN, I WANTED
ALL THIS, BUT...
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

665
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:25,937
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT THAT.

666
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,222
CHECK IT OUT. HEH!

667
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,026
- YOU SEE THIS OLD NAPKIN?
- YEAH.

668
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,311
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHEN I WAS WORKING
AT THAT DINER,

669
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,235
I DREW...

670
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:37,041
THIS LOGO
FOR KEATING RECORDS.

671
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:39,126
DAD, THAT--HEH!--
SHOULD BE IN A MUSEUM.

672
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:42,533
YEAH, I MEAN,
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CREATE SOMETHING

673
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,981
THAT WOULD LIVE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER I WAS
GONE AND IF I WAS LUCKY,

674
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:49,549
I WOULD HAVE A CHILD
TO BE MY BLOOD LEGACY,

675
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:52,355
AND THEN MY MUSIC
WOULD BE MY SOUL LEGACY.

676
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,239
WELL, I RUINED
THAT PART.

677
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,564
NO, YOU ARE THAT PART.

678
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:59,250
YOU ARE MY LEGACY
IN EVERY FORM, LAYLA.

679
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,775
I'M JUST SORRY
IT TOOK ME SO LONG
TO REALISE THAT,

680
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,181
AND I'M GLAD
YOU GOT OUR NAME BACK

681
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:06,185
BECAUSE NOW, MY BLOOD

682
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,631
AND MY SOUL ARE
BACK UNDER ONE ROOF,

683
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,677
AND YOU ARE GONNA TAKE
OUR KEATING LEGACY
TO LEVELS I COULD

684
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:14,764
ONLY DREAM OF
WHEN I WAS WASHING
DISHES IN THIS DINER.

685
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:16,909
THANKS, DAD.

686
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:31,080
HEY.

687
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,044
GRACE: HEY.
BILLY: THANKS FOR COMING TODAY.

688
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:35,049
TURNS OUT I WASN'T
NEEDED HERE.

689
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,055
YEAH, I, MADE
A QUICK U-TURN.

690
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:41,062
GRACE, CHUCKLING: CAN I ASK WHY?
BILLY: SPENCER.

691
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,707
HE WAS RIGHT,
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

692
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,391
HE USUALLY IS.

693
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,961
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL HIM THAT.

694
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:53,329
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT SCHOOL.

695
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:55,935
YEAH.

696
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,912
OK.

697
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,515
ALL RIGHT, SPENCE.

698
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:07,961
TIME TO SPEAK YOUR PIECE
ONE MORE TIME.

699
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:33,780
SPENCER, ON VOICEMAIL:
OH, THIS IS SPENCER.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

700
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,785
HEY, SPENCE, UM,

701
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,749
I KNOW YOU SAID THAT YOU...

702
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,355
YOU NEEDED SOME TIME,
AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THAT, BUT I JUST--

703
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:42,800
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

704
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,764
YOU WERE RIGHT.

705
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,390
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

706
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:51,859
HI, DADDY.

707
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,505
AMINA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU KEEP RUNNING AWAY,

708
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,751
YOUR GRANDMA'S GONNA MOVE
YOU OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

709
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:59,937
SADIE: NO...
I WON'T.

710
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:04,868
CAN I SPEAK TO YOUR DAD
ALONE, PLEASE?

711
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,467
IT'S POSSIBLE
I MISJUDGED YOU.

712
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,115
I TOLD YOU AMINA WOULD BE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU,

713
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:19,561
BUT I CAN SEE HOW MUCH
SHE NEEDS YOU.

714
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,004
THANK YOU.

715
00:31:21,104 --> 00:31:23,008
BUT SHE NEEDS US, TOO.

716
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,013
MY HUSBAND AND I,
WE LOVE HER MORE

717
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:27,618
THAN ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD.

718
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,983
SHE'S ALL
WE HAVE LEFT.

719
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,269
I KNOW.

720
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,397
SO, I...

721
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,402
I'M WILLING TO PROPOSE

722
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,687
A SHARED-CUSTODY
AGREEMENT.

723
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:43,333
REALLY? NO BALTIMORE?

724
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,297
NO BALTIMORE.

725
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:48,504
WE WERE THINKING
2 OR 3 WEEKENDS A MONTH?

726
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:51,711
I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE ANY TIME I
CAN HAVE WITH MY BABY.

727
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:54,918
I WISH IT WAS MORE
THAN THAT, BUT I ACCEPT.

728
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:57,323
NO, YOU MISUNDERSTOOD.

729
00:31:57,424 --> 00:31:59,328
WE WERE THINKING
THAT WE WOULD HAVE AMINA

730
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:01,733
2 OR 3 WEEKENDS
A MONTH AND

731
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,599
SHE'D LIVE WITH YOU,
FULL-TIME.

732
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:21,296
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

733
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:23,501
WORKING, MAN.
YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK.

734
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:26,467
OH, IT'S--IT'S NOT WORK.
I'VE ALREADY FINISHED THAT.

735
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:30,155
I'M WRITING OUT ALL
THE QUESTIONS I HAVE
ABOUT BEING A DAD.

736
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:31,799
FOR REAL?

737
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,403
I MEAN...

738
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:36,129
WELL,
I GUARANTEE YOU,

739
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:37,572
EVEN I WON'T
BE ABLE TO ANSWER

740
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:40,338
ALL THESE QUESTIONS
WE HAVE HERE.

741
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:43,345
"WHAT AGE DO THEY
START WALKING?"

742
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,069
WELL?

743
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:49,318
UM, HONESTLY--HEH!--
I DON'T REMEM--ONE?

744
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:52,124
I FORGET. 1 1/2, MAN?
NEXT QUESTION.

745
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,569
"WHAT IS SWAD--"
I CAN'T READ
YOUR HANDWRITING.

746
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:56,373
WHAT DOES THIS SAY?
"SWADLING"?

747
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,937
"WHAT IS SWADLING?"
ASHER: "WHAT IS SWADDLING?"

748
00:32:58,037 --> 00:32:59,861
"WHAT IS SWADDLING?"
WHAT THE HELL IS--

749
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,825
WHAT IS SWADDLING?
ASHER: I HAVE NO IDEA.

750
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:04,030
SSS. ALL RIGHT.
FORGET THIS LIST.

751
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,037
UM, YOU'RE GONNA
BE FINE, MAN. JUST--

752
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,442
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE
IT OUT ALL ON YOUR
OWN, JUST LIKE I DID.

753
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:12,208
YOU'LL BE COOL,
TOTALLY COOL.

754
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:15,215
ASHER: WAS IT SCARY?
BILLY: OH, HEH HEH!
IT WAS TERRIFYING,

755
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:19,223
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.
IT'S WORTH IT. UM...

756
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:22,831
I REMEMBER WHEN, 
LIV WAS A BABY,

757
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,836
SHE USED TO DO
THIS ONE THING
WHERE SHE'D REACH--

758
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,803
REACH OUT HER ARM
AND JUST GRAB A HOLD
OF MY EAR.

759
00:33:27,903 --> 00:33:30,809
AH, I USED TO LET HER
DO THAT FOR HOURS.

760
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,615
SHE WAS PERFECT.

761
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:36,822
YOU ASKED ME, 
WHAT THE SECRET

762
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:39,829
TO COACHING WAS,
AND, UM...

763
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:42,675
IT'S SIMPLE, MAN.
I JUST TRY TO ACT

764
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:44,920
LIKE A FATHER TO THE
PLAYERS, YOU KNOW.

765
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,965
LIKE, YOU ARE
ALL MY KIDS,

766
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:49,570
AND TO BE HONEST...

767
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,699
YOU WERE ONE
OF MY FAVOURITES.

768
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,349
YEAH, JUST TRY TO BE
SOMEONE THAT THEY'D
LOOK UP TO, YOU KNOW?

769
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,396
ALL YOU CAN DO IS
TRY TO POINT THEM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

770
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,521
AND HOPE THEY STAY
ON THAT PATH.

771
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,806
YOU PUT ME ON
THE RIGHT PATH.

772
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:08,592
I TRIED MY BEST
WITH ALL OF Y'ALL.

773
00:34:10,035 --> 00:34:11,939
YOU GOT A BIG HEART.

774
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,944
YOU'RE A GREAT COACH,

775
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:16,389
AND YOU'LL BE
AN EVEN BETTER FATHER.

776
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,433
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
TO FIGURE IT OUT?

777
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,079
AH, SEE, THAT'S
THE BEST PART
OF ALL THIS.

778
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,725
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW LONG IT'S GONNA
TAKE TO FIGURE IT OUT

779
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:27,594
BECAUSE THE ONE THING
YOU HAVE IS TIME.

780
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:53,150
GRACE: OH, MY LORD.
JORDAN: I DON'T SEE MY DAD.

781
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,515
GRACE: MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STAY IN THE CAR.
JORDAN: NO.

782
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,519
THERE'S ASHER.

783
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,165
JORDAN: ASH,
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

784
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,809
ASHER: I DON'T KNOW.
GRACE: YOU'RE BLEEDING.

785
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:04,735
ARE YOU OK?
ASHER: YEAH, I THINK SO.

786
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,379
BILLY: OK, ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

787
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,945
OK, TAKE IT
NICE AND EASY.

788
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,829
GRACE: JORDAN!

789
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:12,192
DAD!

790
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,297
OH, YOU ALL RIGHT?

791
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,165
OLIVIA: HEY, I'M HEADED OUT.
CHRISTEL: OK.

792
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:21,332
OH, BEFORE YOU GO,
I HAVE SOME MORE NEWS.

793
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,975
LET ME GUESS.
THEY WANT JAYDEN DAVIS

794
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,859
TO DO THE "TODAY" SHOW?
CHRISTEL: CLOSE.

795
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,503
THE ARTICLE'S
BEEN NOMINATED

796
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:28,147
FOR A BARDO
JOURNALISM AWARD.

797
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,550
OH, MY GOD.

798
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,153
OH, MY GOD!

799
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,479
WAIT. BUT IF I WIN,
I CAN'T ACCEPT THE AWARD.

800
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,527
WOMAN: CHRISTEL, WE'RE GETTING
SOME CONFLICTING REPORTS
ON A BUS CRASH.

801
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:40,093
SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS
A FOOTBALL TEAM?
CHRISTEL: OK.

802
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:41,697
WAIT. WHAT?

803
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,301
W-WHERE WAS THE CRASH?

804
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,505
LAURA: HELLO?
OLIVIA: HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?

805
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:48,311
LAURA: I'M AT YOUR PLACE,
ACTUALLY. I JUST CAME BY

806
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,997
TO GIVE COOP SOME GOOD NEWS.
OLIVIA: TURN ON THE TV,
CHANNEL 6.

807
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:53,101
- WHY?
- JUST DO IT.

808
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,095
MAN, ON TV: AS OF NOW,
WE STILL HAVE VERY FEW
DETAILS, BUT WE'RE HEARING

809
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:01,941
A BUS CARRYING A HIGH-SCHOOL
FOOTBALL TEAM CRASHED.

810
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,747
FIRST RESPONDERS ARE
STILL HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING TO THE SCENE.

821
00:36:31,185 --> 00:36:32,489

SIT DOWN, REST.

822
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,493
NO, NO, NO.
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

823
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,297
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST...

824
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:38,301
JORDAN: YEAH, THEY--
THEY SAID A TIRE BLEW OUT.

825
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:40,546
WELL, I THINK I GOT

826
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,869
GOT EVERYBODY OUT.
JORDAN: DAD. DAD?

I'M GONNA GO
CALL SPENCER.

831
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:49,767
BILLY: OK.
GRACE: YOU SHOULD CALL LAURA.

832
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,289
SHE'S PROBABLY HEARD

838
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:06,082
OLIVIA: WHAT?
SPENCER: YOU WANTED
TO TALK EARLIER,

839
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,927
BUT I'VE SORT OF BEEN
AVOIDING YOU TODAY, SO--

840
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:09,971
HAVE YOU NOT GOTTEN
YOUR MESSAGES?

841
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:11,534
MY PHONE'S OFF. WHY?

842
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:13,499
- MY DAD'S BUS CRASHED.
- WHAT?

843
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,505
THE NEWS IS--IS SAYING
THEY THINK EVERYONE'S
OK, AND AMBULANCES

844
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:19,111
ARE ON THEIR WAY, BUT
THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASH
ON THE FREEWAY, SO

845
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,917
FIRST RESPONDERS AND EVERYTHING
ARE A LITTLE DELAYED.

846
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:24,603
LAURA: OH! IT'S BILLY. IT'S DAD.

COOP: YEAH. THEY'RE OK.

00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,997
SPENCER TALKED TO GRACE.

ASHER'S A LITTLE BANGED UP,
BUT HE'LL BE OK.

875
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:40,569
LAURA: OH, I JUST

00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:47,064
LAURA:

878
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:49,349
EXCUSE ME.

879
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:51,955
BILLY, ON VOICEMAIL: SPENCER,

880
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,959
I KNOW YOU JUST SAID
YOU'D NEED MORE TIME,

881
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,963
AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THAT, BUT I WANTED

882
00:38:56,064 --> 00:38:58,649
TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT,

883
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:01,015
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

884
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:03,661
YOU TOLD ME I'D BE CRAZY
TO LEAVE CRENSHAW.

885
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,665
WELL, I JUST TALKED
TO MY TEAM,

886
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,910
AND I TOLD THEM
I'M STAYING.

887
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,955
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG,

888
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:12,359
AND I KNOW
THAT DOESN'T UNDO

889
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,005
WHAT'S HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU
AND ME, BUT I JUST

890
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,411
WANTED TO TELL YOU
SOME THINGS.

891
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:20,257
UM, ONE OF THE REASONS
I TOOK THAT JOB

892
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,903
AT GAU WAS SO I COULD BE
YOUR COACH

893
00:39:23,003 --> 00:39:25,067
ONE LAST TIME.

894
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,273
I MISSED IT.

895
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:29,677
I MISSED YOU.

896
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:31,923
OH, IT'S SELFISH,
I KNOW, BUT WHILE

897
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:34,929
THIS PAST YEAR
AT CRENSHAW HAS BEEN GREAT,

898
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:38,577
BEING YOUR COACH HAD BECOME ONE
OF THE BEST PARTS OF MY LIFE.

899
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:40,943
WE HAVE A CONNECTION,
YOU AND ME.

900
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,949
I KNEW IT THE SECOND WE MET
ON THAT FIELD AT SOUTH CRENSHAW,

901
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,755
AND I KNOW I'M NOT
YOUR POPS, BUT...

902
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:48,961
I DO CONSIDER YOU
MY SON.

903
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:51,405
THAT'S WHY I'LL ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR YOU.

904
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,410
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT LEGACY,

905
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,216
AND I KNOW
SPENCER JAMES IS GONNA CONTINUE

906
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:59,463
TO BUILD HIS LEGACY,
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW

907
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,873
THAT YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT PART
OF MY LEGACY.

908
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:06,919
MY PROUDEST MOMENTS ON THE FIELD
AREN'T PLAYING BALL.

909
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,887
THEY WERE COACHING YOU,

910
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,613
WATCHING YOU GROW INTO
THE PLAYER YOU ARE TODAY

911
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:15,398
AND THE MAN YOU'VE BECOME.

912
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:34,299
BILLY, ON VOICEMAIL: YOU ARE
FAMILY, SPENCER, FOR LIFE.

913
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,387
YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT,
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.

914
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:40,353
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.
WE'RE GONNA GET PAST ALL THIS.

915
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,897
J?

916
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,363
THIS MESSAGE GOT WAY TOO LONG,
BUT, LIKE YOU,

917
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:07,253
I HAD SOME THINGS
I NEEDED TO SAY AND, 
AND I'M GLAD I DID.

918
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:09,257
UM...

919
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:11,101
I LOVE YOU, SPENCER JAMES,

920
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,905
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

921
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,651
YOU ARE MY ALL-AMERICAN.

922
00:41:17,093 --> 00:41:19,639
SO, I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED SOME TIME.

923
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:22,646
UM, I'M HERE
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,

924
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,655
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND ME,

925
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:29,461
WE GOT ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

926
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:31,565
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
