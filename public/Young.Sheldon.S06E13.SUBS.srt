1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,226
<i>Negli episodi precedenti...</i>

2
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:05,578
- Hai un compagno di stanza?
- No, è una singola.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:06,862
Io ho uno chaperon.

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:08,319
Perché hai uno chaperon?

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,795
Magari credono che sia una combinaguai.

6
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:13,366
Visto che mi hai preso
a pugni in faccia, hanno ragione.

7
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,936
- Tu giochi a D&D?
- No,

8
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:18,678
sto sempre in camera a studiare
perché non ho amici.

9
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,366
- Che sfigata.
- Già.

10
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:21,726
Mi sa che vado.

11
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:23,757
Ciao.

12
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:26,218
Dovresti andarle dietro.

13
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,090
Perché? È una sfigata, l'hai detto tu.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,650
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Many cultures</i>
<i>throughout the world</i>

15
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,450
<i>relied on percussion</i>
<i>to send messages</i>

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,450
<i>across long distances.</i>

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,390
<i>For example,</i>
<i>the West African dundun</i>

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,190
<i>was used to imitate</i>
<i>human speech...</i>

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,020
(loud music playing)

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,460
<i>...while I used my fist,</i>
<i>the wall of my dorm,</i>

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,860
<i>and Morse code</i>
<i>to send a message.</i>

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,630
(four knocks)

23
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,980
That's just the letter "H."
What does that mean?

24
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,600
Yeah?

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,970
I'm here to talk to you
about your music

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,870
and your abysmal
Morse code skills.

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,010
What?

28
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,340
Four dots is just
the letter "H."

29
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,910
Was your message "Huh"?

30
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,100
What?

31
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,500
Paige?

32
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,820
Sheldon?

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,620
You know him?

34
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,990
Yeah, no,
we go way back.

35
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,320
What are you doing here?

36
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Would you believe me
if I told you I was working on

37
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,230
a femtosecond laser
in the engineering department?

38
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,030
Yes.
Then that.

39
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,700
You know she's not old enough
to drink beer.

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,530
I'm not old enough
to drink beer.

41
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,170
Yeah, one second.

42
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,500
Come here.

43
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,140
Did I convince you
that drinking is wrong?

44
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,240
Good for me.

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,370
Just leave me alone.

46
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,110
But what are you doing here?

47
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm trying to have fun,

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,980
and I don't want them to know
how old I am.
Why?

49
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,520
Because I want them to think
that I'm cool.

50
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,650
But you're smart.
What's cooler than that?

51
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,320
Just go away.

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,290
Hey, we're fixing to play
some beer-pong. You in?

53
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,720
You should know,
she is not...

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,690
Not had dinner. I have
not had dinner yet, so

55
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,130
we are going
to go get some food.

56
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,400
We are?

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,830
Do you have cash?
Of course.

58
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,270
I always have
an emergency 20,

59
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,800
plus four quarters
for the telephone.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
21 bucks?
Okay, you're buying.

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
We're going the wrong way.

62
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Okay, well, I'm drunk.
You lead.

63
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,840
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

64
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,650
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

65
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,980
* I bet I could be your hero *

66
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,080
* I am a mighty little man *

67
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,900
* <i>I am a mighty little man.</i> *

68
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,290
<i>DINOSAUR (on TV):</i>
<i>Here, take a look at this.</i>

69
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,490
Does this look like tuna to you?

70
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,060
(laughs)

71
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,830
What am I watching?

72
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,770
It's called <i>Dinosaurs.</i>

73
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,240
It's like <i>The Flintstones,</i>
only with dinosaurs. Come on.

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,570
Well, that's dumb.

75
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,970
Well, they talk, he's
got a job. It's fun.

76
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,110
Wasn't <i>The Flintstones</i>
just <i>The Honeymooners?</i>

77
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,810
Huh, I never even
thought about that.

78
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,050
Well, see, you just
kind of ruined it for me.

79
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,250
Good.

80
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,720
Hey.

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,850
Please tell me you brought
some movies home.

82
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,790
<i>Tootsie.</i>
Ooh, thank you.

83
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,860
Really? We're supposed
to believe

84
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,460
Dustin Hoffman is a woman?

85
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,980
But we believe
talking dinosaurs?

86
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,660
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

87
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,400
Little late
to start a movie.

88
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
It's 8:00.

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,070
We're saying the same thing.

90
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,340
So, you want to go home?

91
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,940
Well, I don't know.
I stayed here last night.

92
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,270
So?

93
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,770
So, two nights in a row.

94
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,010
At what point
are we living together?

95
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,550
Fine. Go home.

96
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh, I'm okay with staying.
You're the independent one.

97
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,780
If you want to stay, stay.
If you want to go, go.

98
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,560
Fine. I'll stay
if you're gonna beg.

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,490
And this isn't what I wanted.

100
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,230
Are you still inebriated,
or can we have

101
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,960
an intelligent conversation?

102
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,130
Both.

103
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,930
You do realize that
alcohol kills brain cells.

104
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,200
Ah, but it also makes
life tolerable.

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,640
What do you mean?

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,100
Well, talking to you
is usually annoying.

107
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,540
So you're what's called
a mean drunk. Noted.

108
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,910
I'm messing with you.

109
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,710
It's just, sometimes
life sucks,

110
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,650
and it's easier
not to deal with it.

111
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,780
Could you be more specific?

112
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,150
Um... well, I
have no friends,

113
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,090
I don't fit in anywhere,
and I dropped out of college

114
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,660
but I'm too young
to get a job,

115
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,640
so killing brain cells
makes it easier.

116
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,700
Huh.

117
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,650
Go ahead, smart guy, fix me.

118
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,730
Mm.

119
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, give me a minute.
(stammers)

120
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,070
* Sweet Tootsie roll... *

121
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,010
Well, how do they not see
that's Dustin Hoffman?

122
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,410
I buy it.

123
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,620
So if I put on
a wig and lipstick,

124
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,920
you'd think I was a chick?

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,350
(chuckles)
Only one way to find out.

126
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,690
Nice try.

127
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,370
You do have some pretty
nice legs, though.

128
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,260
Well, if you want,
we could pause the movie,

129
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,130
and I'll let you
touch 'em.

130
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,270
Lucky me.

131
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,300
So I'm assuming you haven't
taken the DARE pledge.

132
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,610
The what?

133
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,010
DARE. It's an acronym.

134
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,170
It stands for Drug Abuse
Resistance Education.

135
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,280
It's not too late.
You can take it now.

136
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,550
I promise not to do drugs,
to avoid violence,

137
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,350
to be responsible, and to
make responsible choices.

138
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,120
Now you say it.

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,490
No.

140
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,850
I dare you.

141
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,190
Clever, right?

142
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,720
Because I still have
all my brain cells.

143
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,110
Sheldon, just eat your pizza.

144
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,260
Hey. You guys going to a party?

145
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,600
Uh, Gamma Kappa house.

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,170
Cool.

147
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,500
Mm, you know,
Officer McDaniel was in charge

148
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,140
of our DARE program.

149
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,770
One time, he even brought in
his drug-sniffing dog Alfie.

150
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,680
Which I didn't care for,
but it was nice to see

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,460
a dog gainfully employed
and off the streets.

152
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,550
MEEMAW:
Really? You're gonna
leave your socks on?

153
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,880
DALE:
My feet get cold.

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,150
MEEMAW: Take 'em off.
DALE: What do you care?

155
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,150
MEEMAW:
It feels like
a lack of commitment.

156
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,590
DALE:
Aw, fine.

157
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,960
MEEMAW:
When was the last time
you cut your toenails?

158
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,290
DALE:
I don't know.

159
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,830
MEEMAW:
Seriously, you look
like something

160
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,530
that could swoop down
and pick up a squirrel.

161
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,500
(knock on door)

162
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,800
Look who's here. Come on in.

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
Thanks.

164
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Everything okay?

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,710
Mind if I hang out here
with y'all?

166
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,970
Come on, mama.
(pats couch)

167
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,040
Need a break from Connie?

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,150
I'm just trying to give
her and Dale some privacy.

169
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,120
Gross.
Oh.

170
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,800
What?

171
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,250
Oh, nasty.

172
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,260
Wait, sex, right?

173
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,260
Yeah.

174
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,860
Missy's at a sleepover

175
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,530
if you want to use her room.

176
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,160
I might take
you up on that.

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,010
You'll be safe here.
They never do anything.

178
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,600
(rock music playing,
lively chatter)

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,340
What are we
doing here?

180
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,210
It's a party, Sheldon.

181
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,680
But we weren't invited.
I didn't bring a gift.

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,940
Then go home.

183
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,110
Wait, this is dangerous.

184
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,550
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>There I stood,</i>
<i>the classic hero</i>

185
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,380
<i>outside the dragon's cave.</i>

186
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,550
<i>Should I risk life and limb</i>
<i>to save the maiden?</i>

187
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,520
<i>My every instinct said no.</i>

188
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>But I drank a lot of root beer</i>
<i>and really had to go pee-pee.</i>

189
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,210
* Let's go! *

190
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,320
(rock music playing,
lively chatter)

191
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,410
Hell does exist.

192
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,560
Excuse me. Where's
the nearest restroom?

193
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,950
Hey, look, Pee-wee
Herman's at our party!

194
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,820
ALL (chanting):
Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee!

195
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,350
Pee-wee! Pee-wee!

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,890
The hell continues.

197
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,290
Pee-wee! Pee-wee!

198
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,740
(toilet flushes)

199
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,700
Oh, thank goodness.

200
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,500
Come on!

201
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,490
Hey, there's a line.

202
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,530
Oh, boy. New hell.

203
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,180
<i>(Dale cries out)</i>
MEEMAW: <i>What?!</i>

204
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,510
What?!
Charley horse. Charley horse.

205
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,320
What-what do I do?
I don't know. (stammers)

206
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,650
Here, rub it,
rub it, rub it.

207
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,550
That's kind of how this whole
thing got started. (snickers)

208
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,250
That's not funny.
Mm-hmm.

209
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,140
You'll laugh later.

210
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,430
DALE:
Rub harder. Harder.

211
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,590
MEEMAW:
I'm rubbing as
hard as I can.

212
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,400
DALE:
Well, use your elbow.

213
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,660
MEEMAW: All right.
(Dale groaning)

214
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,130
I don't need my toothbrush.

215
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,500
MEEMAW:
You like that?

216
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,000
DALE:
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

217
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,670
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>This night of depravity</i>
<i>had reduced me</i>

218
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,170
<i>to urinating on a tree</i>
<i>like a forest animal.</i>

219
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,580
<i>How much worse could it get?</i>

220
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,410
PAUL:
Hey, Pee-wee's back!

221
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,850
ALL (chanting):
Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee!

222
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,530
Pee-wee!

223
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,520
Excuse me.

224
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,790
I'm looking
for my friend.

225
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,290
Blonde girl,
about a meter and a half.

226
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,660
(rock music and lively chatter
continue)

227
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,690
* Suck the poison out... *

228
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,160
Excuse me. I'm looking for...

229
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,970
Missy?
Sheldon?

230
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,270
What are you doing here?

231
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,370
What are you
doing here?

232
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,700
Do Mom and Dad know
you're here?

233
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
Do Mom and Dad know
you're here?

234
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,640
Okay, stop. You go first.

235
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,610
Heather's sister
goes to school here.

236
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,180
She invited us.
Now you.

237
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,910
I'm looking after Paige.

238
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,850
Where is she?

239
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,100
Well, I didn't say
I was doing a great job.

240
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,120
Where's your toothbrush?

241
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,620
I don't want to talk about it.

242
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,460
(phone ringing)

243
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,630
Who the hell calls
at this hour?

244
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,260
Hello.

245
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,730
Oh, hi.

246
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,360
Everything okay?
Who is it?

247
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,630
Heather's mom.
Oh. Is everything okay?

248
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,500
You just heard me ask.
Wh-What's up?

249
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,760
No, Heather's not here.
They're at your house.

250
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,810
Huh.
What?

251
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,340
Heather told her mom
she was staying here.

252
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,630
(chuckles)
Classic.

253
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,650
Paige is drunk?

254
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,590
And high on what
Officer McDaniel's called

255
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,990
Mary Jane, reefer and ganja.

256
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,390
Is she okay?
No.

257
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,760
She said her life is terrible.

258
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,830
What?
Her life is terrible.

259
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,830
What?

260
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,510
(rock music continues loudly)

261
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,120
(music stops)

262
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,020
Her life is terrible.

263
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,520
(crowd murmuring)

264
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,780
(muttering)

265
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,380
How's your sex
cramp, old man?

266
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,380
Athletes get cramps
all the time.

267
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,520
It comes from dehydration,
overexertion.

268
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,990
I'll give you
the dehydration,

269
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,790
but I didn't see any
overexertion, though.

270
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,190
Why, Connie?

271
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,930
'Cause it's fun.

272
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,530
Well, just give me
a minute, I'll be ready.

273
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,060
Why don't we just
call it a night

274
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,230
and get some sleep?

275
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,600
That's fine by me,
but just to be clear,

276
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,940
you're calling it,
not me.
Yep.

277
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm good to go.
I'm sure you are.

278
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,070
Yep.

279
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,930
Damn tootin'. (groans)

280
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,350
I don't know if it's any
help, but when I was her age

281
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,550
and pulled this, it was
just to go to a party.

282
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,980
(scoffs)
Oh, great.

283
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,750
So she's at a party,
who knows where.

284
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,890
GEORGE SR.:
You know what?

285
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,920
I'm gonna go find her.
How?

286
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,690
I don't know. I'm just--
I'm gonna drive around

287
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,960
till I hear some carousing.
I'll go with you.

288
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,360
Will you both just
stop for a minute?

289
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,920
There's nothing to do but wait.

290
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,080
Fine.

291
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,110
Nope. Georgie, let's go.

292
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,570
Let's check out that
creek in the woods

293
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,640
where they found
the headless body.

294
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,980
GEORGE SR.:
Will you shut up.

295
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,040
(sighs)
Now what do we do?

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,450
We can't just leave.
Paige is still in there.

297
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,050
Maybe we should call Mom.

298
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,450
I do have four quarters
for that exact reason.

299
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,240
Paige?

300
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,620
Wait!

301
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,320
What are you doing?

302
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,330
Well, this is Bradley, and
we're going to another party.

303
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,060
Another party? It's 9:30.

304
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,580
Bradley, do you know
how old she is?

305
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,330
She said she was 18.

306
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,800
Lower.

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,340
Sixteen?

308
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,610
Lower.

309
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,690
Okay, I got to go.

310
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,100
Thanks a lot.

311
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,380
Come on.

312
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,170
We're running again?

313
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,140
We just ran.

314
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,430
I'll tell you what.

315
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,330
My daughter's never gonna
put me through this.

316
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,370
Oh, really? How you figure?

317
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,340
I'm gonna run a tight ship.
Set some rules, some boundaries.

318
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,040
If she breaks them,
then she faces the...

319
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,140
Oh, what do you call it?
Repercussions.

320
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,040
(snickers)

321
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,830
Why you smiling?

322
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,650
I just can't wait
till you're a dad.

323
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,600
Thank you.

324
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,090
"Repercussions."

325
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,790
It's a word. Look it up.

326
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,360
(sighs)

327
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,690
MISSY:
Hurry!

328
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,530
This is as fast as I can go
in sensible shoes.

329
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,590
(Paige retching)

330
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,960
(groans)

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,030
You okay?
No.

332
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh, dear.
What?

333
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm going to have the
mother of all blisters.

334
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,800
(sighs)

335
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm worried about you.
Thank you.

336
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,740
Well, don't be.

337
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm having fun.
You're drunk

338
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,610
and you were about to get
in the car with some stranger.

339
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,610
So? He was cute.
What's wrong with you?

340
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,880
You're smarter than Sheldon.
Why don't you act like it?

341
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,880
Um...
I am.

342
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,350
If that was true, then how come
my pizza's still in my stomach

343
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,690
and yours is in the fountain?

344
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,320
(groans)

345
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,390
What good is being smart
if you're all alone?

346
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,160
Let's go to Sheldon's
so I can get you cleaned up.

347
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
(groans softly)
Thanks.

348
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,100
Just so you know,
you're not alone.

349
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,470
You've got me.

350
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,200
I thought we were trying
to make her feel better.

351
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,770
(music playing quietly
over radio)

352
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,910
I'll tell you another idea I
have for keeping my kid in line.

353
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,910
Oh, can't wait.
I seen this show
where they put

354
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,910
these electric trackers
on these dolphins.

355
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,580
And with satellites, they
can tell exactly where they are.

356
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,980
Dolphins?

357
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,280
Go on.

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,450
I'm gonna stick one
of them things in my kid

359
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,780
so I always know where she is.

360
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,520
So you're gonna keep track
of your daughter

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,850
like she's an animal.

362
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,540
Damn straight.

363
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,580
Actually a really good idea.

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,260
Missy's a good kid.
I'm sure she's okay.

365
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,870
(sighs)

366
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,270
I was a good kid.

367
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,040
Didn't stop me from
getting into trouble.

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,270
(chuckles) Me, too.

369
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,420
One time,
I was at this party and...

370
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,810
Actually, never mind.

371
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,260
The important thing is
we survived.

372
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes, we did.

373
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,750
(inhales deeply)

374
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,180
You just want your children
to have an easier time of it.

375
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,850
Easier.

376
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,310
My baby's gonna have a broke
single mom and a teenage dad.

377
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,690
Mm-hmm.

378
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,530
Let me get you some more tea.

379
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,260
Okay.

380
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,530
You know what else is nice?
Hmm?

381
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,170
I get to learn from
all your parenting mistakes.

382
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,570
I'm starting to think

383
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,400
letting you live this
long was one of 'em.

384
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,570
Like that. I'd never say
something so awful to my kid.

385
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,910
(scoffs)

386
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,060
Thanks, big guy.

387
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,380
(crickets chirping)

388
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,180
You awake?

389
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,430
Mm-hmm.

390
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,320
I've been thinking.

391
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,990
We don't have to spend
every night together.

392
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,660
Wow.

393
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,460
You're preaching to the choir
there, Connie.

394
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,230
I've been lying awake here
for an hour,

395
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,360
wishing I were back home
in my own bed.

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
Really?

397
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,470
Everything's
the way I like it there.

398
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,100
Got a TV in the bedroom

399
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,470
and leave the seat up
on the toilet.

400
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,410
And thermostat's not set
to storing meat.

401
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,410
I did turn the
toilet paper around

402
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,850
so it comes over the top
like you like it.

403
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,010
Like the world likes it.

404
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,350
Don't start on this again.
(chuckles)

405
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,250
Hee-hee.
(chuckling)

406
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,950
So, we got a plan?

407
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,220
We got a plan.

408
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,910
Mm.

409
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,230
(sighs)

410
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,490
(grunts)

411
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,960
So I'll spend
tomorrow night at my place.

412
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,100
Yep.

413
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,020
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

414
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Where you going?

415
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,840
Think I might have
to crank up the AC.

416
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
DALE:
<i>'Cause I said "thank God"?</i>

417
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
MEEMAW:
<i>No fooling you.</i>

418
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,910
(quietly):
Okay, she's asleep.

419
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,380
I put a trash can by the bed
in case she gets sick.

420
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,150
Where am I supposed
to sleep?

421
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,420
On the floor.

422
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,720
Why can't she sleep
on the floor?

423
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,020
She doesn't even know
where she is.

424
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,560
I don't have time for this.

425
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,890
I have to find Heather
before I lose my ride home.

426
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,690
Fine.
But first,

427
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,960
we have to get
our story straight

428
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
about where I was tonight.

429
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,060
There's only one story,
and it's straight:

430
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,070
you were here.

431
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,400
No, I wasn't.

432
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,670
I was at Heather's,
and you didn't see me.

433
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,500
Got it?
First I have to sleep
on the floor

434
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,940
and now I have to lie for you?

435
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,310
How 'bout this?

436
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,340
Work with me, and I will
officially owe you one.

437
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
One what?

438
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,280
I don't know. One anything.

439
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,880
"Anything" is awfully vague.

440
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,820
What say we draw up
a contract or...
Sheldon, you went

441
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,950
to a frat party; now there's
a drunk girl in your bed.

442
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,190
That's the coolest college story
you'll ever get to tell.

443
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,290
So I <i>can</i> tell Mom.

444
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,220
No. Someday.

445
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,720
When?

446
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,830
Someday when we're old
and we can laugh about it.

447
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,230
I got to go.

448
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,630
(sighs)

449
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,100
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>30 years later,</i>

450
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,070
<i>still not laughing.</i>

451
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,450
(crickets chirping)

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,670
What are you
doing out here?

453
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,370
It's the middle
of the night.

454
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,810
I can't sleep
not knowing where she is.

455
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah.

456
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,280
(grunting)

457
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,470
(sighing)

458
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,220
So we're on the same page,
when she does show up,

459
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm gonna kill her.

460
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,120
You're gonna have
to beat me to it.

461
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,860
Not saying
I love her the most,

462
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,840
but if anything
happened to Missy...

463
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,200
She is your
little girl.

464
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,700
Not so little anymore.

465
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,500
Hmm.

466
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,800
And I hate it.

467
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,370
Well, pretty soon, you're
gonna have a granddaughter.

468
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,010
Start all over again.

469
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,790
(chuckles)
(snorts)

470
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,000
You know,
I had an idea.

471
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,350
I'm gonna put a tracker on her,
like they do with dolphins.

472
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,680
You're making that up.
No, it's true.

473
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,720
Yeah, wherever she goes--

474
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Timbuktu, doesn't matter--

475
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
we're there.

476
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,610
(snorts)

477
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,610
(both sigh)

478
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,240
(door opens)

479
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,170
MISSY:
I'm home!
(door closes)

480
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,240
(footsteps approaching)

481
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,380
Hey.

482
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,880
Hey to you.

483
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,380
How was Heather's?

484
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,550
Uh, fun.

485
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,550
Pizza, movies--

486
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,220
the usual.

487
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,780
You look tired.

488
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,090
I didn't sleep
too well.

489
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,150
Oh. Sorry.

490
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,570
Well, I'm gonna go to my room.

491
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,930
What happened to killing her?

492
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,030
I'll get to it.
(door closes)

493
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,480
Just so relieved she's okay.

494
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,300
(slurps, smacks lips)

495
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,600
Okay, I'm good. Missy!

496
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,590
Wait for me!
